Prompt Title: Rare Car with Arre Background — AI Workflow Prompt

Purpose:
Create a clear, actionable prompt for generating a high-quality image or video of a rare car set against an arre background. The prompt should be ready for use in AI image generation pipelines, 3D rendering, or automation systems.

Prompt Structure:
1) Objective
- Produce a photorealistic render of a rare car with an arre background that emphasizes exclusivity and craftsmanship.

2) Subject Details
- Car: A rare, exclusive model. Avoid using brand names or real trademarks unless provided by the user.
- Mood: Elegant, enigmatic, and premium.
- Color and finish: Metallic or pearlescent finish with subtle, natural reflections.

3) Background (arre background)
- Describe arre background accurately and vividly. If arre implies an arresting or dramatic setting, specify elements such as lighting contrast, depth, and color palette. Suggested palette: deep charcoals, electric blues, and warm amber highlights. Include environmental elements (e.g., architectural lines, urban glow, or desert horizon) that reinforce rarity and prestige.

4) Lighting and Camera
- Lighting: Studio-like key light with soft fill; optional rim light to outline the silhouette.
- Mood lighting: High-contrast, cinematic, with subtle colored reflections on the car surface.
- Camera: Low to mid-angle, 35mm to 50mm equivalent; shallow depth of field to isolate the car; detailed reflection capture on curves.
- Frame composition: Centered on car silhouette, negative space to emphasize exclusivity; ensure horizon and background elements align with perspective.

5) Technical Requirements
- Resolution: 8K or 7680x4320; deliver PNG or TIFF.
- Output: High-detail front3/side3/3-quarter renders; provide layers/passes if applicable (albedo, specular, normal, depth).
- Style references: cinematic automotive photography, macro detail shots, and refined luxury catalogs.

6) Constraints and Acceptance Criteria
- No visible brand logos or trademarks unless user-provided.
- Realistic materials: metal, glass, rubber, leather; accurate specular highlights and micro-surface details.
- Color accuracy and tonal range to maintain realism across lighting conditions.
- The final prompt should be deterministic and reusable in AI workflows.

7) Example Prompt (for reference, replace with car-specific details when available):
- Generate a photorealistic 8K render of a rare luxury car with an arre background, matte-black body with chrome trim, neon urban arre background with warm amber highlights, cinematic lighting, 3-quarter view, shallow depth of field, 8K PNG with layered passes.

Notes:
- Replace placeholders with actual car details if provided.
- Maintain professional tone suitable for design brief or automation pipeline.
