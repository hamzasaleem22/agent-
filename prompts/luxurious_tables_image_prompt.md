# AI Image Prompt — Luxurious Tables

## Primary Prompt (copy/paste)
Create an ultra-photorealistic, cinematic luxury product scene featuring a **limited-edition, high-end designer table** as the hero subject. The table is an **oval slab of rare Calacatta gold marble** with bold, natural veining, resting on a **sculptural brushed-brass pedestal base** with subtle engraved detailing and seamless joinery.

**Environment & Setting:** A minimalist penthouse showroom overlooking a modern city skyline at dusk through floor-to-ceiling glass. The space includes polished limestone flooring, a muted textured plaster wall, and a curated art piece in the background (softly out of focus). Keep the scene spacious with premium interior styling—no clutter.

**Mood & Emotion:** Quiet opulence, exclusivity, and refined craftsmanship—gallery-like calm with a sense of elite, invitation-only design.

**Lighting (cinematic):** Soft key light from the left (large diffused softbox feel) creating gentle, controlled highlights along the marble edge and brass curves. Warm rim light from behind to emphasize silhouette. Subtle practical ambient light from recessed ceiling spots. Natural dusk light outside adds cool-blue fill and depth. Deep, clean shadows; no harsh hotspots.

**Color Palette & Luxury Mood:** Warm neutrals (ivory, champagne, sand) with **gold accents** from brass; cool twilight blues in the background for contrast. High dynamic range, tasteful saturation, premium editorial color grading.

**Materials & Textures:**
- Marble: polished, glass-smooth surface with realistic micro-reflections and visible depth in veining.
- Brass: brushed finish with fine anisotropic reflections, slight patina variation, crisp edges.
- Floor: honed limestone with subtle pores and soft specular highlights.

**Material–Light Interaction:** Physically accurate reflections and refractions; marble shows soft, creamy specular bloom; brass catches warm highlights with controlled falloff; glass wall exhibits faint reflections of the table.

**Perspective & Composition:** Low three-quarter angle, 50mm lens look; table centered with slight asymmetry for elegance. Foreground includes a soft blur hint of a luxury chair edge (out-of-focus) to add depth. Strong leading lines from floor tiles toward the hero table. Medium depth of field: table razor-sharp, background gently bokeh.

**Style & Aesthetic:** High-end interior/product photography, modern luxury, editorial design magazine cover, impeccable styling, museum-grade presentation.

**Detail Level & Visual Quality:** Hyper-detailed, photorealistic, 8K, ultra-clean render, masterpiece polish, crisp micro-texture, no noise artifacts.

**Rarity & Value Cues:** Include subtle cues like a small engraved metal plaque near the base reading “Edition 01/50” (not a brand logo), and flawless craftsmanship with invisible seams.

**Atmosphere & Visual Effects:** Subtle volumetric haze for depth, faint dust motes in the light beam, gentle city bokeh outside, soft vignette.

## Negative Prompt
Low resolution, blurry, cheap materials, plastic look, overexposed highlights, harsh glare, warped geometry, messy clutter, excessive props, cartoon, illustration, low-poly, noisy grain, text artifacts, watermarks, logos, distorted perspective, bad reflections, unrealistic lighting.

## Suggested Parameters (optional)
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (hero environment) or 4:5 (editorial)
- Style: photorealistic, cinematic, luxury product photography
- Focus: sharp on table surface and base; background bokeh
