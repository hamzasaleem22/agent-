Honda Civic Image Prompt

Purpose: Generate a photorealistic, AI-ready prompt for creating a high-quality Honda Civic render. This prompt is crafted for studio/product visualization workflows and should yield a book-cover quality image suitable for marketing assets.

Prompt:
- Subject: Honda Civic sedan, refined and athletic, in a photoreal studio render.
- View: Front three-quarter angle, slight low camera tilt for a dominant stance.
- Lighting: Softbox key light at 45° to the subject, fill light on opposite side, subtle backlight to separate from background. High dynamic range with controlled specular highlights on the body panels.
- Environment: Neutral seamless studio backdrop with a cool gray gradient (from #eceff4 to #cfd6e0). Floor reflection subtle, not overpowering.
- Camera: 50mm equivalent focal length, aperture f/8, ISO 100, shutter 1/125s for a crisp, noise-free image.
- Styling: Glossy red paint (e.g., Rallye Red), clean wheels, visible Honda badge on grille and trunk, no branding clutter.
- Details: Accurate wheel design, brake calipers, tire texture, and subtle badge reflections. Include crisp reflections of studio lighting on bodywork.
- Resolution: 4K (3840x2160) output, color space sRGB, exported as PNG with transparent background where applicable.
- Output prompts: Include a descriptive alt-text for accessibility and a sample caption suitable for marketing.

How to use:
1) Feed this prompt into your preferred AI image generation model.
2) Review for alignment with brand guidelines (Honda visual identity) and adjust lighting and pose if needed.
3) Upscale to 4K and compress for web use if required.
