# Prompt: 8K Honda Civic Modification Visualization

Objective:
- Generate a hyper-detailed 8K render of a Honda Civic with comprehensive modifications across exterior, performance, and interior features.

Subject:
- Car: Honda Civic (model year not specified for flexibility)
- Theme: High-contrast color scheme; bold, striking aesthetics
- Modifications: full exterior body kit, upgraded wheels, lowered suspension, aero enhancements, performance exhaust, engine touches, interior upgrades

Visual Requirements:
