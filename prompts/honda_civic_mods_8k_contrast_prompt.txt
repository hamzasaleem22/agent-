Prompt: High-Quality 8K Image Prompt for a Honda Civic with Extensive Modifications (Contrast Theme)

Objective:
Create a photorealistic, 8K-resolution image of a Honda Civic that showcases a comprehensive set of modifications. The theme emphasizes strong contrast between the car color and the accents, delivering a visually striking, performance-oriented stance.

Car and color scheme:
- Model: Honda Civic (10th/11th generation aesthetic, clearly identifiable features such as badge shape, headlights, and silhouette).
- Primary color: Deep, glossy black (or near-black) body.
- Accent color: Electric lime green accents for trim, aero components, brake calipers, and interior stitching.
- Finish: Ultra-high gloss on body panels with subtle pearlescent flake to catch light; matte accents only where intentional (e.g., roof panels, spoiler lip) for contrast.

Modifications to include (comprehensive list, visually prioritized):
- Aerodynamics: widebody kit, flared fenders, carbon fiber front splitter, side skirts, rear diffuser, large rear wing; vented hood or performance hood with heat extraction vents.
- Wheels and brakes: lightweight multi-piece forged wheels with aggressive offset; high-performance ceramic brakes with visible calipers in lime green; performance tires with clear tread detail.
- Suspension: lowered ride height with adjustable coilovers; subtle negative camber at the front for aggressive stance.
- Exterior details: carbon fiber mirror caps, etched grille, neon lime green edge lighting or ambient door sills; door handles and trim color-matched where appropriate.
- Lighting and reflections: PRISTINE HDR lighting to reveal reflective surfaces; front lighting should emphasize projector LEDs; add subtle backlit glow around accents.
- Interior (visible through windows): sport seats with lime stitching, carbon fiber steering wheel, digital gauges showing boost/torque, lime-green seatbelts or stitching accents.
- Engine bay (slightly visible through open hood): clean, organized layout with performance intake and valve cover accents in lime green; chrome or ceramic-coated components with meticulous detailing.
- Badging: discrete, tasteful performance badges (e.g., Type-R inspired cues) without overpowering the Civic identity.

Environment and composition:
- Camera: 35mm equivalent, slightly low angle for a dominant stance.
- Composition: three-quarter front view with a touch of rear 3/4 to highlight widebody and rear aero.
- Setting: urban street at golden hour with shallow depth of field; reflective wet pavement or glossy ground to enhance reflections, subtle bokeh in the background.
- Lighting: natural warm tones from golden hour; rim lighting on the car edges to emphasize silhouette; ensure lime green accents pop without overpowering the scene.

Resolution and quality:
- Target resolution: 8K (7680 × 4320)
- Output: photorealistic, ultra-detailed textures (carbon fiber weave, paint flake, tire tread, brake rotor detail)
- Noise: minimal; ensure clean, crisp edges for all modifications

Prompt brevity and consistency guidelines:
- Use clear, concrete nouns and adjectives; avoid vague terms.
- Keep a single-pass prompt body with hierarchical bullet points for readability.
- Maintain a professional, technical tone suitable for AI image generators.

Usage notes:
- This prompt is intended to guide an image-generation model to produce a single, final 8K render suitable for portfolio usage.
- If the model supports style presets, apply a photorealistic, high-contrast preset in tandem with the above details.

Optional variants:
- If you want an alternate color-contrast pairing, swap to a satin white body with electric blue accents, preserving the same modification list and composition.
